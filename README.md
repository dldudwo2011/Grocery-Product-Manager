.NET5 - Query and CRUD functionality

This is a virtual website made with .NET 5 to perform Query and CRUD operations on a grocery company.

Please follow these steps to see my work working.

1. Import the bacpac file (Grocery list) in your SQL Server Studio Management.
2. Run the server in visual studio with the src file provided and test the query and CRUD functionality by clicking the Query and CRUD tabs in the menu.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Query items from the database.
- CRUD functionality with the database.
- Implement pagination.
